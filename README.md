Matching your monitor’s refresh rate (Hz) with your game’s frame rate (FPS) can lead to a smoother and more visually consistent gaming experience. For example, if your game runs at 60 FPS, setting your monitor to 60 Hz is usually the best choice. Here’s why:

When your monitor refreshes at the same rate as the game delivers frames, each frame is displayed cleanly without overlap. This reduces screen tearing, input lag, and visual stutter. On the other hand, if your FPS and Hz are mismatched (e.g., 60 FPS on a 144 Hz monitor), you may experience inconsistent frame delivery, where some frames are shown longer than others, causing a choppy or jittery appearance.

In short, syncing your FPS and Hz helps the game feel smoother and more responsive, especially in scenarios where frame rate is locked or capped. It's a simple tweak that can significantly improve visual quality and gameplay comfort.
