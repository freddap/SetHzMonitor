App that automatically switches refresh rate based on running processes.

Matching your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate (Hz) with your game‚Äôs frame rate (FPS) can lead to a smoother and more visually consistent gaming experience. For example, if your game runs at 60 FPS, setting your monitor to 60 Hz is usually the best choice. Here‚Äôs why:

When your monitor refreshes at the same rate as the game delivers frames, each frame is displayed cleanly without overlap. This reduces screen tearing, input lag, and visual stutter. On the other hand, if your FPS and Hz are mismatched (e.g., 60 FPS on a 144 Hz monitor), you may experience inconsistent frame delivery, where some frames are shown longer than others, causing a choppy or jittery appearance.

In short, syncing your FPS and Hz helps the game feel smoother and more responsive, especially in scenarios where frame rate is locked or capped. It's a simple tweak that can significantly improve visual quality and gameplay comfort.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Installer Version
Download the setup file and follow the installation wizard to install the application on your system.


### 2. Portable Version
Download the portable version, extract the contents to any folder, and run the application directly.  
No installation is required.


For detailed information on how the software works and any necessary configuration, please see the [Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md).

### 3. Requirements & Optimization Tools

As a complement to this app, I recommend using [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download) (RivaTuner Statistics Server) to limit your FPS. RTSS allows you to cap the frame rate to match your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate, which helps reduce screen tearing, lower system load, and maintain stable frame pacing‚Äîespecially in games that don‚Äôt offer native FPS limiters.

Using both tools together can significantly improve your gaming experience by syncing FPS and Hz for optimal smoothness and responsiveness.

Please make sure the [.NET Runtime 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0/runtime) is installed on your system in order to use this application.
